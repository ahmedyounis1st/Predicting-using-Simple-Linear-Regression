# TSF GRIP Task 1 - Predicting using Supervised ML
In this section we will see how the Python Scikit-Learn library for machine learning can be used to implement regression functions. We will start with simple linear regression involving two variables.

Tools used:
+ Python
+ Simple Linear Regression
+ Jupyter Notebook
